# Phantom Investigations

Phantom Investigations is a digital unit of Phantom Records, GP, dedicated to identifying, exposing, and resolving cyber fraud and digital threats that impact our operations and our members. Unlike physical law enforcement which is tasked with real-world safety, we focus on the virtual space â€” where data theft, impersonation, and network intrusion occur, often without remedy.

We aim to empower our team and invited partners to collect evidence, track behavior patterns, and develop real-time digital countermeasures to protect our assets. This repository serves as the public landing page for our mission, findings, and legal disclaimers.
