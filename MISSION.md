## Mission Statement

To build a comprehensive digital investigations platform that proactively counters cyber fraud targeting Phantom Records, GP. We aim to conduct internal investigations with a clear protocol, avoiding the traditional law enforcement pathway that often proves ineffective for cyber crime.

This initiative protects victims' rights, limits exposure to external interference, and prevents tipping off perpetrators. We believe victims deserve digital autonomy in pursuing justice.
